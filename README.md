# Sunset Hills

## A unique stand-alone website designed to accept user inputs and respond with a custom solution

This site is compiled of two HTML pages that each serve their own purpose. You will land on the index, which will be the page that you interact with. Use the input boxes to determine each of the five building's heights. 
The "Initiate Sunset" button will call two functions. One to show the column chart, and one to perform the loop comparison of inputs. 
The "Clear Heights" button will clear the input and result boxes, allowing the user to enter new heights and get the appropriate results without refreshing the page. 

***Note:***
- The graph template was imported from [canvasJS](https://canvasjs.com/) and modified/styled by me
- The code snippets on the Code page are powered by [prismJS](https://prismjs.com/)
